# Walmart Project


I have developed a Python project using Jupyter Notebook to predict sales and demand for Walmart stores. By analyzing historical sales data from 45 stores, I implemented statistical modeling techniques and machine learning algorithms to improve sales forecasting accuracy.  <br>

Key Project Highlights:  <br>

1 - Analyzed sales data from 2010 to 2012, considering factors like store number, date, weekly sales, holidays, temperature, fuel price,       CPI, and unemployment rate.  <br>
2 - Identified the store with the highest sales and the store with the most variability in sales. <br>
3 - Calculated the coefficient of mean to standard deviation to assess sales consistency. <br>
4 - Examined quarterly growth rates for stores in Q3 of 2012. <br>
5 - Identified holidays with higher sales compared to non-holiday periods. <br>
6 - Provided insights into monthly and semester sales trends. <br>
7 - Built a prediction model for Store 1 using linear regression, considering date, CPI, unemployment, and fuel price as predictors. <br>
8 - Transformed dates into days for further analysis. <br>

Through this project, I demonstrated proficiency in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques. By leveraging Python and Jupyter Notebook, I showcased my ability to extract valuable insights, improve sales forecasting accuracy, and make data-driven recommendations for enhancing business performance <br>
