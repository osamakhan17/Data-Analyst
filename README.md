# Walmart Project


I have developed a Python project using Jupyter Notebook to predict sales and demand for Walmart stores. By analyzing historical sales data from 45 stores, I implemented statistical modeling techniques and machine learning algorithms to improve sales forecasting accuracy.

Key Project Highlights: 

1 - Analyzed sales data from 2010 to 2012, considering factors like store number, date, weekly sales, holidays, temperature, fuel price,       CPI, and unemployment rate.
2 - Identified the store with the highest sales and the store with the most variability in sales.
3 - Calculated the coefficient of mean to standard deviation to assess sales consistency.
4 - Examined quarterly growth rates for stores in Q3 of 2012.
5 - Identified holidays with higher sales compared to non-holiday periods.
6 - Provided insights into monthly and semester sales trends.
7 - Built a prediction model for Store 1 using linear regression, considering date, CPI, unemployment, and fuel price as predictors.
8 - Transformed dates into days for further analysis.

Through this project, I demonstrated proficiency in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques. By leveraging Python and Jupyter Notebook, I showcased my ability to extract valuable insights, improve sales forecasting accuracy, and make data-driven recommendations for enhancing business performance
